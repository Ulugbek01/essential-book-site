The noise <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>scared </strong>her, so she walked quickly back to her room.</p><p>The next night, her friend Liz came to her house.

Mia had to do something.

But how did the jackal get his black back? This was how it happened.</p><p>One day, the jackal saw a girl. She was sitting upon a rock. She was not a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>normal </strong>child. She was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>rare </strong>and beautiful sun child. She was bright and warm like the sun. The child saw the jackal and smiled.</p><p>She said, &ldquo;Jackal, I have been <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>relaxing </strong>on this rock for too long. I must get home soon. But, I am slow and you are fast. You will <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>likely </strong>get me home more quickly.&rdquo; Then she <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>requested</strong>, &ldquo;Will you carry me home? If you do, I&rsquo;ll give you a gift. This necklace <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>belongs </strong>to me, but I will give it to you.&rdquo;</p><p>The wild jackal agreed. So the sun child sat on the dog&rsquo;s back. They started to walk. But soon, the jackal felt ill. The sun child was very hot on his back. The heat was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>hurting </strong>his back very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>badly</strong>. &ldquo;I made a terrible <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>error </strong>in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>judgment</strong>.&rdquo; he thought. He shouldn&rsquo;t have agreed to carry her. So he asked her to get off.</p><p>But she did not. The jackal&rsquo;s back <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>continued </strong>to get hotter and hotter. He had to get away from the sun child. So he made a plan. First, he ran as fast as he could. He hoped the sun child would fall off. But she did not. So when the sun child was looking at the sky, not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>aware </strong>of the jackal&rsquo;s next plan, he jumped into a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>field </strong>of flowers. As a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>result</strong>, the child <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>rolled </strong>off his back. The jackal ran away.</p><p>But the sun child left a mark on the jackal&rsquo;s back, a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>visible </strong>black mark. Ever <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>since </strong>his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>experience </strong>with the sun child, the jackal has had a black back.</p>",

The Inuit people of Alaska have a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>theory</strong>.</p><p>They tell a story about a beautiful girl. She was very nice. In <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>contrast</strong>, her brother was a mean little boy. One day he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>proposed </strong>something. &ldquo;We should go to a party,&rdquo; he said. The girl <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accepted</strong>. First, it was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>necessary </strong>for her to prepare. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>arranged </strong>her hair and put on nice clothes. This <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>required </strong>a lot of time. But the girl worked hard, and soon she had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>success</strong>. She looked perfect.</p><p>They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>attended </strong>the party together. The girl was having fun. Later, she walked into the bathroom. Suddenly, the lights were turned off! Someone <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>grabbed </strong>her hair and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tore </strong>her clothes. She ran out of the bathroom. She wanted to know who did this to her.</p><p>Then she had an idea. She fixed her hair again. This time it was even more beautiful. She even <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>balanced </strong>beautiful jewels in it. She wanted to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>encourage </strong>the person to grab it again. She put black dirt in her hair. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>purpose </strong>of this was to catch the person.</p><p>She went to the bathroom again, and it was the same <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>pattern</strong>. The lights went off, and someone grabbed her hair. When he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>released </strong>it, his hand was black. The girl returned to the party. She knew there was only a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>single </strong>person with a black hand. When she saw that person, he was very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>familiar</strong>. It was her brother!</p><p>He ran into the woods. The girl ran after him. They both carried fire so they could see in the dark. The smoke went into the air. As they ran, they grew. They became <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>huge</strong>. Then they went into space. When the girl&rsquo;s fire went out, she <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>hung </strong>in the sky. She became the moon, and her brother became the sun. They chase each other forever.</p>",

I sat and watched the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>waves </strong>and listened to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>ocean</strong>. I learned to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>identify </strong>birds. I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>discovered </strong>pretty things and enjoyed the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>taste </strong>of new foods. It was a very nice time.</p><p>One evening I took a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>pleasant </strong>walk by the ocean. When the waves came in, many starfish* fell on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>beach</strong>. Some starfish went back into the water, and they were safe. But other starfish were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>still </strong>on the sand. They would die if they did not get into the water. There were many starfish on the beach that night. It made me sad, but I knew I could not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>fix </strong>the problem. I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>stepped </strong>very carefully so I did not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>damage </strong>them.</p><p>Then I saw a little girl. She was also sad about the starfish. She wanted to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>prevent </strong>all of them from dying. She asked me if I could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>perhaps </strong>help her.</p><p>&ldquo;To be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>frank</strong>, I don&rsquo;t think we can do anything,&rdquo; I said.</p><p>The little girl started to cry. She sat back <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>against </strong>a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>rock </strong>and thought for a while. Finally, the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>emotion </strong>was gone. She stopped crying and stood up. Then she picked up a starfish and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>threw </strong>it into the water.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; I asked her. But she did not answer me. She just threw as many starfish as she could. &ldquo;You cannot <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>save </strong>all of them!&rdquo; I said.</p><p>She stopped to look at me. &ldquo;No, I cannot save them all,&rdquo; she replied. Then she picked up a very big starfish and said, &ldquo;But I can save this one.&rdquo; And then she smiled and threw the starfish as far as she could into the ocean.</p><p><em>*starfish - an animal shaped like a star that lives in the water</em></p>",

But one thing about him wasn&rsquo;t normal. He was born with 100 eyes. Having many eyes was usually a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>benefit </strong>to him. He had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>chance </strong>to see many things.</p><p>Also, since he had so many eyes, he was very good at <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>guarding </strong>things. While sleeping, he only <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>rested </strong>a few eyes at a time. The others stayed awake. He worked for Hera, a great goddess. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>primary</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>function </strong>was to guard a special cow. The cow was very important to Hera. It was her favorite pet. The most <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>essential </strong>part of his job was to keep the cow alone. It had to be kept <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>separate </strong>from all the other cows and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>far </strong>away from people.</p><p>This was an easy job for Argos. The cow just ate <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>grass </strong>all day. But the god Zeus wanted the cow. He wanted to take it away from Hera. He had a plan. He found a great music player. He asked the man to play a beautiful song for Argos. Zeus was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>certain </strong>Argos would go to sleep.</p><p>The song had an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>immediate</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>effect</strong>. Argos couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>focus </strong>on his job. He fell asleep. Zeus saw this, and he took the cow.</p><p>Hera was very angry with Argos. She turned him into a peacock. She put his many eyes on his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tail</strong>. Argos was very sad.</p><p>Zeus saw how much <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>trouble </strong>he had caused Argos. He made another plan. He turned Argos into a group of stars. He wanted Argos to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>remain </strong>in the sky forever. Even today, Argos&rsquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>image </strong>remains there, above the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>site </strong>where all his problems began. We can still see him in the night sky.</p>",

She was tired of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>competing </strong>with her daughter. She made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>decision</strong>. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>prepared </strong>a drink for the princess. After the princess drank it, she fell <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>asleep</strong>. Then the queen took the princess to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>forest</strong>. She left the princess there. It was a very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>serious </strong>thing to do. &ldquo;<strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>Either </strong>she will be killed by animals or she will get lost in the forest,&rdquo; the queen thought.</p><p>The princess had a dream. She dreamed about a man with brown hair and brown eyes. It was the man she would wed.</p><p>The princess <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>woke </strong>up. She saw a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>strange</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>creature</strong> on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>ground</strong>. It looked like a man, but he was hairy and green. He had horns on his head and a pig&rsquo;s nose.</p><p>The creature said, &ldquo;Did I scare you? I hope not. Let me <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>introduce </strong>myself. I am Henry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not scared. To tell you the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>truth</strong>, I think you are cute,&rdquo; said Rose.</p><p>Rose and Henry <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>spent </strong>the day together. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>collected</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>berries</strong>, caught fish, and had lunch. They had a very good day filled with nice <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>conversations</strong>.</p><p>&ldquo;Rose, I have to go home,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;My ship will <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sail </strong>home soon. I can&rsquo;t leave you here in the forest alone. Will you come with me?&rdquo;</p><p>Rose was very happy. She gave Henry a kiss right on his pig nose. As soon as she kissed Henry, he began to change. His pig nose turned into a man&rsquo;s nose. His horns and green hair went away. Standing in front of her was the man Rose had dreamt about.</p><p>Rose and Henry were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>married</strong>, and they lived happily.</p>",

The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>quality </strong>of his paintings was very high. He always used the best <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>materials</strong>. He made a big <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>profit </strong>from his paintings. He had delicious <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>meals </strong>with his rich <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>neighbors</strong>. He taught art classes. Life was good.</p><p>Then his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>attitude </strong>changed. He stopped selling paintings and teaching. He tried a new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>method </strong>of painting. He stayed <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>alone </strong>in his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>apartment </strong>all day. He worked all day and all night, rarely eating. Soon Frenhofer became very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>thin</strong>. But he kept working on the same painting for many years. He worked as hard as he could.</p><p>Finally, he finished the painting. He was very happy and invited other artists to see it. &ldquo;I want your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>professional </strong>opinion,&rdquo; he said. He wanted them to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>judge </strong>it and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>compare </strong>it to other paintings. Everyone was very excited as they went up the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>stairs </strong>to his apartment. Frenhofer was excited to show his painting, and the artists were excited to see it. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll love it,&rdquo; he thought. But they did not.</p><p>They were surprised by his painting. There was no white anywhere. Frenhofer filled the whole painting with lines and colors. There was no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>space </strong>for a normal picture. It was full of strange <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>shapes</strong>. It looked bad to the other artists. He used <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>symbols</strong>, and they didn&rsquo;t understand them. They thought it was terrible. &ldquo;Why did you paint this strange picture?&rdquo; someone asked. They didn&rsquo;t understand its beauty.</p><p>But after some time, many people began to like his painting. People wrote <strong>articles </strong>about it in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>magazines</strong>. They said it was his best work. They loved his strange symbols. They loved his strange colors. Frenhofer&rsquo;s painting reminded everyone that just because something was new didn&rsquo;t mean that it was bad. He also helped them to realize that sometimes it takes people a little time to understand great things.</p>",

One summer, their farm <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>burned</strong>. One <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>structure </strong>caught fire, and most of the animals ran away.

She just wanted to sit and read all day.</p><p>One day, a small book came in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>mail</strong>. It was for Sarah. The book looked very special. It was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>printed </strong>on <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sheets </strong>of gold. Sarah began to read. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>outline </strong>of the story was simple. It was about a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>magical </strong>place. Strange things happened there. One <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>example </strong>from the book was about a boy who could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>control </strong>people.

He gave the turtle an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>opportunity </strong>to win, and the turtle took it. The duck handed the turtle his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>prize</strong>. It was the happiest day of the turtle&rsquo;s life.</p><p>The dog was happy for the turtle. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t fast,&rdquo; the dog thought. &ldquo;But he tried his best and did something great.&rdquo;</p>",

But Joe&rsquo;s soccer team had a game.</p><p>Next, Tom went down the hall to Brad&rsquo;s room. Brad was reading a very large old book. &ldquo;Hi, Brad,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;Are you reading a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>dictionary</strong>? It looks <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>ancient</strong>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. This is called The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>Wealth </strong>of Adams <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>County</strong>. It&rsquo;s about <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>hidden </strong>gold in Adams County. It&rsquo;s more than a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>century </strong>old. It was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>published </strong>in 1870! Look, it even has the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>original </strong>cover on it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tom asked, &ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from my dad&rsquo;s friend. He is a nice <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>gentleman</strong>, an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>officer </strong>in the army,&rdquo; answered Brad.</p><p>&ldquo;The gold doesn&rsquo;t really <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>exist</strong>, does it?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>maybe</strong>! There are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>clues </strong>to it in this book. Let&rsquo;s find it!&rdquo; Looking for gold sounded like fun.</p><p>The first clue was to find a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>flat </strong>tree underground. &ldquo;It must be in the forest,&rdquo; Tom said.</p><p>Brad said, &ldquo;The flat tree could be a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>board </strong>under the dirt. It could cover the gold.&rdquo;</p><p>Tom and Brad dug in the dirt all morning. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>process </strong>of looking for gold made them hungry. They were ready to stop for lunch. But then Brad hit something hard. It was a board!</p><p>Brad <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>pounded </strong>on the board until it broke. There was a small hole under it. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; He held up a gold coin.</p><p>Tom saw a piece of paper in the hole. &ldquo;Brad, there&rsquo;s more. It&rsquo;s a map to the rest of the gold!&rdquo;</p><p>Brad smiled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; And they hurried to find the wealth of Adams County.</p>",

Coronado wanted to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>achieve </strong>his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>goal </strong>very badly.</p><p>Coronado and his men rode for many days. Then they saw some cities. &ldquo;We found the Seven Cities of Gold!&rdquo; his men yelled, but Coronado wasn&rsquo;t happy.

The cities weren&rsquo;t bright and golden. They were dirty and brown. The people didn&rsquo;t eat meat from golden plates. They ate <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>vegetables </strong>from regular bowls. They wore the most <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>basic </strong>clothes.</p><p>Coronado <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>regarded </strong>the cities as ugly places. &ldquo;What happened to the cities of gold?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Did someone <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>destroy </strong>them?

They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>advised </strong>Coronado to go home. &ldquo;There is no gold here,&rdquo; they told him. Coronado was angry.

The sun <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>reflected </strong>light dirt houses. Coronado thought he saw a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>bit </strong>of gold.

To her, the kids&rsquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>average</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>behavior </strong>was very bad. No girl <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>matched </strong>her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>personality</strong>. She hated it.</p><p>One day, they had a class. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>Mental </strong>exercise <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>sounded </strong>good to Stacie. But it was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>course </strong>on water <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>safety</strong>. They learned how to be safe <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>passengers</strong> on a boat. Stacie didn&rsquo;t ever plan to go on a boat.</p><p>The next day, they played a game. There were a red team and a blue team. Stacie was on the blue team. Each team had to try to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>remove </strong>the other team&rsquo;s flag from a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>pole</strong>. They also had to use water guns. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much of an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>athlete</strong>,&rdquo; she said. But she still had to play.</p><p>Stacie took a water gun and looked for somewhere to hide. A boy said, &ldquo;Stacie, you <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>advance </strong>to the middle. I will go right. Those two will go left.&rdquo;</p><p>Stacie still didn&rsquo;t want to play. She walked into the forest and saw a red team player coming.

A red team <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>member </strong>was watching over it. She shot him with her water gun. Then she <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>lowered </strong>the flag and ran back to her team. &ldquo;I got it!&rdquo; she yelled. The blue team won!

He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>performed </strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>exercised </strong>in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>public </strong>park. He did this to show everyone how strong he was. Most people liked him, but one man didn&rsquo;t. His name was Jack.</p><p>Jack hated Tim. Jack was a movie <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>critic </strong>and the smartest man in town. He could solve <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>complex </strong>math problems. But no one cared. Jack wanted to be famous like Tim.</p><p>One day, there was an unusual <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>event</strong>. A big storm came suddenly. Snow covered the town. No one could get out. They needed food. The people said, &ldquo;This is a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>task </strong>for a strong man.&rdquo; Tim was under <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>pressure </strong>to save them. But Jack wanted to be the hero, so they both went. Tim said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help because of your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>lack </strong>of strength.&rdquo;</p><p>But Jack found some small <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>passages </strong>under the snow. One of them led toward another town. That town had food. Because Tim was so big and strong, he almost couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>fit </strong>inside. They walked until there was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>block </strong>of ice in their way. Jack said, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get past it. But if you <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>strike </strong>it, it might break.&rdquo; Tim knew that was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>probable</strong>.</p><p>He broke it. When there were more ice blocks, Tim broke them. That made him tired. He couldn&rsquo;t walk anymore. Jack said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>unite </strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>support</strong> each other. I&rsquo;ll get the food alone. You rest here.&rdquo;</p><p>Jack came back with food. Tim couldn&rsquo;t remember which passage led home. He needed Jack to be his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>guide</strong>. The men became friends by working together.</p><p>In town, people saw Jack with the food and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>cheered</strong>. They called Jack a hero. But Jack didn&rsquo;t care. He was thinking of something else. He said to Tim, &ldquo;I thought I was smart, but I learned a new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>term </strong>today: <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>friendship</strong>.&rdquo;</p>",

This factory <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>produced </strong>a lot of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>trash </strong>and put it in a river. The trash and water were a bad <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>mix</strong>. People <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>populated </strong>the area by the river and drank its water. This made them sick. Many of them needed <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>medicine </strong>and made <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>regular </strong>visits to doctors.</p><p>But the video wasn&rsquo;t all bad news. It showed ways to pick up trash and why it&rsquo;s important to do this. It said people can make a difference to their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>environment</strong>. The video&rsquo;s important <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>features </strong>made Joe <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>associate </strong>trash with hurting people.</p><p>One day Joe walked through a park. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>recognized </strong>some of the problems from the video. One <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>instance </strong>of these problems was the trash in the pond. It was full of plastic cups. There was too much trash. Joe didn&rsquo;t want it to hurt anyone.</p><p>He told his grandfather about the park. His grandfather said, &ldquo;You know, it&rsquo;s a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>tradition </strong>in our family to help people. That&rsquo;s why we give food to poor people. Maybe you can help people by cleaning the park.&rdquo;</p><p>Cleaning the park would <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>involve </strong>hard work. Joe decided to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>organize </strong>a group to help him. He chose a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wide </strong>area of the park. It had the most trash. He asked his family and friends to come. On Saturday, he gave everyone a sharp stick. They wondered why. He said, &ldquo;You use the stick&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>tip </strong>to pick up trash. This makes it easier.&rdquo; They worked for six weeks. Different people helped each time, but Joe was always there.</p><p>In that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>period </strong>of time, Joe saw a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>range </strong>of results. There was no trash in the water. People could swim in it. Joe knew that was a good <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sign</strong>. He was happy because he helped his environment.</p>",

If the bug&rsquo;s answer was correct, he let it go. If not, he ate it.</p><p>One day, a small bird on a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>journey </strong>flew into the spider&rsquo;s web. The spider couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>imagine </strong>eating a bird. It was so big! But his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>hunger </strong>was too great. He said to the bird, &ldquo;If you cannot give me a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>specific </strong>answer, I will eat you.&rdquo;</p><p>The bird laughed. &ldquo;I could eat you!&rdquo; But the bird was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>actually </strong>scared.

And a spider&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>bite</strong> can be very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>effective </strong>in killing animals.</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t eat me,&rdquo; the bird said. &ldquo;I would <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>rather </strong>make a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>deal </strong>with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; the spider said. &ldquo;If your answer is right, I will let you go.

It must be something of great <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>value</strong>.&rdquo;</p><p>The bird said, &ldquo;You can pick anything you want to eat.

Now you must find some bugs for me.&rdquo;</p><p>The spider climbed on the bird&rsquo;s back. They flew and ate bugs together.

He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>preferred </strong>to keep the world <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>cool </strong>and dark. He wanted to stop the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>progress </strong>of the city. The animals couldn&rsquo;t work in the dark. He didn&rsquo;t have any <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>respect </strong>for them. &ldquo;Light is too good for them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only I should have light.&rdquo;</p><p>But the animals needed light. So they decided to hold a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>competition</strong>. They wanted to find the smartest animal in Darkland. That animal had to steal light from the president. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>advertised </strong>the competition everywhere. All the animals came.</p><p>The animals all showed off their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>skills</strong>. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>audience </strong>watched and then <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>voted </strong>for the animal with the most <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>knowledge</strong>. The winner was a tall bird named Raven. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>assigned </strong>him the job of getting light.</p><p>The next morning, Raven ate <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>breakfast </strong>and then left his home. &ldquo;How will I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>gain </strong>light from the president?&rdquo; thought Raven. He needed to trick the president <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>somehow</strong>. Then, Raven had an idea. Raven could make his voice sound like anything!</p><p>Raven walked up to the president&rsquo;s door. He made the sound of a crying baby. He cried very loudly. Soon, the president opened the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; the president yelled. Right then, Raven quickly made his move. He flew by the pig and found the soft bag. He took it outside. The sun was inside the bag!</p><p>Raven flew high and put the sun in the sky. The president was very mad. Raven tricked him! But the other animals were very happy. At last, they had light&mdash;all because of Raven&#39;s smart thinking.</p>",

But where did this idiom start?</p><p>It came from a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>section </strong>of England. Long ago, people there went from town to town to sell things like vegetables, clothes, and pigs. They had strong <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>beliefs </strong>about <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>honesty</strong>. They didn&rsquo;t like lying. One day, a man went to the section&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>center </strong>to sell things.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a baby pig for sale! It won&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>cost </strong>much,&rdquo; he said. He held the animal <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>above </strong>his head. His style was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>different </strong>from honest people&rsquo;s style. He was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>master </strong>of tricking people and lying.</p><p>A woman named Beth <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>scanned </strong>his pig. He offered her the pig for one gold coin. That was a very small <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>amount</strong>. Beth gave him the coin. He put it in his pocket. He walked <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>ahead </strong>of Beth to get the pig.</p><p>He gave her a closed bag and said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your pig.&rdquo; He then left very quickly.</p><p>Beth looked at the bag&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>surface</strong>. It was moving. She opened it to let the pig out. A cat was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>inside</strong>! &ldquo;He tricked me! That isn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>proper</strong>,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Later, the man returned to trick more people. Beth saw him and the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>memory </strong>of the cat came back. She told her friends. They stopped him. But no one knew what to do next.</p><p>Someone said, &ldquo;We need an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>independent </strong>and fair person to decide that.&rdquo; They went to the judge. Beth told him about the cat in the bag.</p><p>The judge asked, &ldquo;Is there <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>evidence</strong>? Can you <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>demonstrate </strong>how he did it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look in his bag,&rdquo; said Beth. She opened it and let a cat out of the bag. They learned the man&rsquo;s secret, and he went to jail.</p><p>That&rsquo;s how the idiom &ldquo;let the cat out of the bag&rdquo; came to mean to tell a secret.</p>",
